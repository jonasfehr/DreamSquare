# DreamspaceSeries
The DreamspaceSeries are pieces to deep dive into the edge of your consciousness where you get lost in time.
I have always been fascinated by the hypnotic effect when looking into the glow of an almost burnt down bonfire.
Or the shadows cast on the wall when light rays from the sun are passed through leafs on a tree swinging in the wind.

## Technique
Using a shader I sweaping trough the rows of an image taking each row and stretching it out.
This output is then composed using a projection mapping software layering multiple outputs and adding color corrections to finalize the composition.
The timing and the image-row selected are based on an older algorithm of mine, which I call walkers. Based on a random number, the "walker" will interpolate from a previous random value to a new one in a given rhythmic pattern.

## HypnoticPulseOfStatistics

## Technique
Both pieces are based on the same technique using the "walker" algorithm described above. However, there are 7 walkers in parallel, having a repetitive slow rhythm. Also these pieces create a kind of hypnotic character, but are much more simple in their expression.

# Thoughts on publishing as NFT
To be distributed as NFT the pieces could be written in webGL and would ideally be published as generative piece never repeating ever. As plan B, the algorithm could be tweaked to have it's randomness looped - allowing to create video-loops where the repetition gets lost in the complexity of the image. Combining the shaders with probability maps, the final compositions could be auto-generated to create bigger collections or to be minted on demand.
